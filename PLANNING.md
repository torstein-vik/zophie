Platform for mathematical knowledge management, with an web-based conversation-like interface.

### List of mathematical types

- Category (every category has objects and morphisms)
- Functor (every functor has a domain category and a target category)
- Machine (every machine has an input class and an output class)
- Set (every set has elements)
- Class (every class has members)




### List of meta-mathematical types

- Author
- Institute
- Journal
- MSC2010 label


### Examples for prototype building

- Add the category of topological spaces
- Add some properties that topological spaces can have, for example Hausdorff, compact, metrizable
- Add some properties that morphisms of topological spaces can have, for example being closed, being surjective
- Add the category of commutative rings...


# Project Architecture

A simple client-side with possibility to answer questions about mathematics. Should work with very simple html, because God knows some mathematicians use ancient technology. However, it should be enhanced with javascript and CSS (cross-comapitible).  

Server-side should contain all the interesting mathematics, with a database of everything. Should create intellegent questions. We can deploy using Firebase, and use a language with a strong typing system for computational ascpects.

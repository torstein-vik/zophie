### List of mathematical types

- Category (every category has objects and morphisms)
- Functor (every functor has a domain category and a target category)
- Partially defined functor (every one has a )
- Machine (every machine has an input class and an output class)
- Set (every set has elements)
- Class (every class has members)

### Examples for prototype building

- Add the category of topological spaces
- Add some properties that topological spaces can have, for example Hausdorff, compact, metrizable
- Add some properties that morphisms of topological spaces can have, for example being closed, being surjective
- Add the category of commutative rings...
- Add the set of partially defined functions from the reals to the reals

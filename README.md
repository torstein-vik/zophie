## Architecture

Mostly still in planning, but see Languages/Frameworks for some ideas about the architecture.

## Languages/Frameworks

* Hosting/Maintenance: Firebase
* Server-side: Node.js which recieves all events from the client-side, and delegates computational aspects to other services. Another idea could be to implement everything in javascript, but this seems slow and difficult. 
* Client-side: Possibly Angular, but maybe React or Vue as well.
* Displaying math: MathJAX, hopefull server-side but maybe just client-side.

#### Note

This is very subject to change, and only specifices the current plans.

## Folder structure

* /planning -- Files for the planning of the project
* /planning/ui-sketch -- Sketch of the UI

* /firebase/ -- The root directory for the firebase project. NOTE: FILES ARE NOT EDITED HERE, BUT BUILT FROM /src/
* /firebase/public -- Public directory with all the hosted files
* /firebase/function -- Directory with the server-side logic

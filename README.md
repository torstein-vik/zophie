## Overview

## Installation

1. Make sure you have installed Node.js and the firebase-tools package
2. Clone this repo to your computer
3. Login to Firebase (with 'firebase login')
4. Update .firebaserc to accommodate whatever your Firebase project is
5. In the firebase directory, use 'firebase serve' to run locally and 'firebase deploy' to deploy online.

## Architecture

Mostly still in planning, but see Languages/Frameworks for some ideas about the architecture.

## Languages/Frameworks

* Hosting/Maintenance: Firebase
* Server-side: Node.js which recieves all events from the client-side, and delegates computational aspects to other services. Another idea could be to implement everything in javascript, but this seems slow and difficult. 
* Client-side: Possibly Angular, but maybe React or Vue as well.
* Displaying math: MathJAX, hopefull server-side but maybe just client-side.

#### Note

This is very subject to change, and only specifices the current plans.

## Folder structure

* /planning -- Files for the planning of the project
* /planning/ui-sketch -- Sketch of the UI

* /firebase/ -- The root directory for the firebase project. NOTE: FILES ARE NOT EDITED HERE, BUT BUILT FROM /src/
* /firebase/public -- Public directory with all the hosted files
* /firebase/function -- Directory with the server-side logic

Zophie needs to understand words and concepts. The cleanest way to keep track of this is with one large list of concepts, without the corresponding 'words'. We should have a second list of words, which lists all the words and which concepts (plural) they correspond to. With this system we can have multiple words for the same underlying thing, and not specify exactly what is meant in every situation. For instance the word 'the integers' will correspond to many different concepts.

We should also keep track of the following:
* For each concept, have a 'disambiguator'-field which is a sort of label which makes the concept unique in the ontology. This is an informal data field with the purpose of disambiguating words for the user.
* We also need a 'context'-object which keeps track of which contexts the word may appear in. How this should be done is still unclear, but this object should contain things like 'type' or 'category number'.

We can also discuss the need for concept and word families, where we for instance can have each integer as a concept, with a specified syntax. This will also necesitate concept parameters.
